First, we should say we recommend using the Jupyter notebook named
Test File - CSTR Example to test CKBIT since it is better displayed 
and all functions are within a single file. However, we recognize some
users will be more comfortable with standard Python scripts, so the 
test files have been provided in this format as well:

Test_file-generate_data.py - File used to generate the simulated data used for testing
Test_file-MAP.py - file used to test the MAP functionality of CKBIT
Test_file-MCMC.py - file used to test the MCMC functionality of CKBIT
Test_file-VI.py - file used to test the VI functionality of CKBIT

Please reference the Word document in this folder named Test File - Outputs Comparison
to find the examples of the outputs this software should generate when running
properly.
