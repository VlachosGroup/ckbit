This is the README file for the CKBIT software for reviewers. This is 
different from the README file that will accompany the software on
its Github page because they are for a different audience with 
difference needs. The more extensive README is available for review
within the documentation, but the information requested for submission
is summarized here for your convenience.


File/directory structure:

In the ckbit software folder, there are 2 folders:
ckbit: contains the source code
docs: contains documentation and example code

In the docs folder, you will find html files that document the software.

You will also find a folder named Jupyter Notebook Examples, in which
there are examples of the software run in Jupyter Notebook and the 
accompanying Excel input files. One of these notebooks is a test file 
that can be run to ensure the program operates as specified (it is named
"Test File - CSTR Example.ipynb").

You will also find a folder named Python Script Examples, in which there
are examples of the software in standard Python scripts and the 
accompanying Excel input files. Some of these files are test files 
that can be run to ensure the program operates as specified (they are named
"Test_file-MAP.py", "Test_file-MMC.py", and "Test_file-VI.py")


Installation instructions:

Installation instructions can be found in the docs folder in the html
file named "installation.html".


Test run of the software:

The software can be tested either in a single Jupyter notebook, or in
a series of Python scripts. They provide the same code and tests, just in
different mediums. Please reference the troubleshooting section of the
documentation if necessary.

The Jupyter notebook is named "Test File - CSTR Example.ipynb" and is
located in the Jupyter Notebook Examples folder inside the docs folder.
Once CKBIT is installed, this test file can be executed in a standard
Jupyter notebook interface. There are other Jupyter notebooks in this folder
that showcase the functionality of the software.

The Python scripts are named "Test_file-MAP.py", "Test_file-MMC.py",
and "Test_file-VI.py" and are located in the Python Script Examples folder
inside the docs folder. Once CKBIT is installed, these test files can be 
executed in a standard Python interface, such as Spyder. There are other 
Python scripts in this folder that showcase the funcitonality of the software.

Documentation:

In the docs folder, you will find html files that document the software.
