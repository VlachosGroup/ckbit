Chemical Kinetic Bayesian Inference Toolbox (CKBIT)
===================================================

The **C**\hemical **K**\inetic **B**\ayesian **I**\nference
**T**\oolbox (CKBIT) is a Python library for applying
Bayesian inference to kinetic rate parameters developed
by the Vlachos Research Group at the University of Delaware.

Documentation
-------------

Examples
--------
There are examples of the code in the Github examples 
folder. The examples are provided in both Python scripts 
and in Jupyter notebooks. Ensure the accompanying Excel 
files are used as templates for data entry.
